                        exercising the right to receive compensation shall be
                        brought before the courts competent under the Code of

                    correspondence address or by electronic means. The

                    the request. That period may be extended by two further
                    months where necessary, taking into account the complexity
                    and number of the requests. The controller shall inform the
                    data subject of any such extension within one month of

                    charge a fee for providing the information or taking the
                    action requested. Where requests from a data subject are
                    manifestly unfounded or excessive, the controller may refuse
                    to act on the request. The controller shall bear the burden
                    of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded or excessive
                    character of the request.
