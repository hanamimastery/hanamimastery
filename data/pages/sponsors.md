## The Sponsorship History Log

Hanami Mastery is an **Open Startup kind of thing**, so we keep having a [Public track of the revenue and outcomes](https://hanamimastery.notion.site/Hanami-Mastery-Finance-Log-61466ad21a9f4fe4807e13836cbd32f1).

However, even though I myself in this field want to be transparent, **I value your privacy way more than my transparency**. Having that said I:

1. Keep income channels in the log above in general categories.
2. If you as a person or company don't want to be listed on my videos nor articles/pages, let me know.

You can check there, how much support I got and how much support I give.

:::important[Disclaimer]
While I keep in public
- all the income
- impact on the Open-Source world
- investments
- and expenses

I may restrict this information to **my sponsors only in the future**.

## How to support Hanami Mastery?

If you really enjoy my content or get benefits from it, you're welcome to support me, our [YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/HanamiMastery), and the whole [HanamiMastery initiative](/about) by [sponsoring on Github](https://github.com/sponsors/swilgosz) or sending a donation of your choice.

- [Github sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/swilgosz)
- [Buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/swilgosz)

**If you need a different channel** to sponsor this project, [just let me know](https://twitter.com/sebwilgosz)!

**At least 10% of all profits** related to this project **I get in any way** is directly transferred to support Hanami's development (more on that below).

### Why I need sponsorship?

**1. I'm just a human**

Hanami Mastery is a non-standard project. **It's all about supporting other great Open-Source work** and as usually if it comes to Open Source, **a lot of the work is never paid off**.

We all need to live our lifes though.

I am Ruby developer myself and a triple father. At the moment I need to work Full-Time as a developer to fulfill my family needs and no matter how much I'd love to move full-time to content creation, I cannot do it at the moment.

I am committed to evolve this project, so **if you want me to put more effort and more time into it**, well, I need your help with it.

**2. By supporting Hanami Mastery you support the whole Hanami ecosystem and related gems**

At least [10% of ALL the income](https://hanamimastery.notion.site/Hanami-Mastery-Finance-Log-61466ad21a9f4fe4807e13836cbd32f1) I get in any way (excluding my regular developer's job) is transferred directly to support Open-Source world, **starting from Hanami core team**, then related libraries maintainers and contributors.

**3. I am actively working on other income channels.**

I am seeking for support only to start and build other channels of income, **to not rely on the direct support long-term**, but bring actual value to the Open-Source community.

Here are rough plans of different income channels.

1. [Github and direct sponsorships](https://github.com/sponsors/swilgosz)
2. I'm actively looking for sponsorship from companies (job ad spots, product advertising - look for more details in [collaboration page](/collaboration))
3. Affiliate links - writing reviews of books I read and recommend, app stacks, and so on.
4. [Hanami Mastery PRO](https://hanamimastery.teachable.com/) (coming soon!)
5. Online courses - I already [released one course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ruby-on-rails-api-the-complete-guide/) but it's not related to Hanami Mastery in any-way. More online courses connected to this initiative coming soon!
6. Book creation (future plans)
7. Youtube channel

Sponsorship is only the one pillar of strategical income - but extremely important one as it allows me get sustainable business and reinvestments from the start when other channels are not possible to be build yet.

It means, that **your sponsorship allows me to grow faster**, and achieve additional sources of income sooner to start better and bigger initiatives, making more impact to change the world of open-source financing.

**4. I don't want to become a millionaire from your money.**

My comfortable income level is kept around ~90k USD/year and this is more or less what I'm earning as a developer.

**If at any point I'll exceed this level from Hanami Mastery Income, I'll no use that exceed for my private benefits** but only for reinvesting into open-source support initiatives and direct OSS financing.

To prove that, on top of the monthly financial log I'll publish **yearly financial reports** from Hanami Mastery Project.

**5. There is NO demand nor claim on my side.**

It's my responsibility to build my work in a safe manner without making you guilty of revoking meaningful support.

This means **you can revoke your support at any time, without any bad feelings from my side**. I appreciate your contributions to this idea and I'll do my best to build trust in the community **and never fail it**.

For certain support levels I'll give additional benefits for your company according to [sponsors layers](https://github.com/sponsors/swilgosz)

I'd love to make Open Source projects an amazing place to work as a full-time job.
