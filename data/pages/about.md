:::important[Our Mission]
Make **Open-Source** projects **an attractive way for full-time jobs**!
:::

<br />


**I strongly believe that great community projects should get more support and financial stability**. Unfortuantely, most of amazing people who create great libraries and projects, need to work during nights and over the weekends **to make OUR lives better**.

To make things worse, creating a great OpenSource project require great technical capabilities, while monetising it is related to possesing decent MARKETING skills.

**Those two usually don't play well together**, which makes great open source maintainers and contributors to suffer for working for free.

[HanamiMastery](https://hanamimastery.com) is a first step, to improve on that field.

### Rules

This project is driven by a few simple rules.

- **10% (At least) of all income generated by this project and activity goes to support Hanami development since day one**.
- This includes Github sponsoring of my account, Youtube Channel, Blog monetization, income from affiliates, my premium products (courses, subscription) and so on. Just everything related to Hanami Mastery income.
- As soon as the Hanami 2.0 is released, we'll publish at least one episode per week.
- The evolving list of activities and Initiatives I'm running atm is placed on the [collaboartion page](/collaboration)
