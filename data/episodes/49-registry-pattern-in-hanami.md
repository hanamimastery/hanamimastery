I ported a tiny Todo app using to Hanami.[ðŸŽ¬ 1]

It has been written as a plain ruby application and it\'s not written using the Hanami way.[ðŸŽ¬ 2]

One challenge it faces is the complex web of dependency management, where certain objects are frequently that get passed around to multiple components.

Lets take for example, the database. We have our main object, the `TodoApp`{.verbatim}.[ðŸŽ¬ 3] It has an instance creation method[ðŸŽ¬ 4] which returns a new instance of the application[ðŸŽ¬ 5] and it receives the database as an argument.[ðŸŽ¬ 6]

Then, on the initializer,[ðŸŽ¬ 7] it assigns this database instance.[ðŸŽ¬ 8] Subsequently, methods like `todo_tasks`{.verbatim} [ðŸŽ¬ 9]and `done_tasks`{.verbatim} create a new `TaskList`{.verbatim} object,[ðŸŽ¬ 10] which also receives the database instance on it\'s `load`{.verbatim} method.[ðŸŽ¬ 11]

``` ruby
module MyTaskList
  class TodoApp
    def self.load(db:)
      new(db: db)
    end

    # ...

    private

    attr_reader :db

    def initialize(db:)
      @db = db
    end

    # ...
  end
end
```

We\'ve passed the database to two classes so far. As I said before, this is a tiny app, and by that, I mean that it\'s an application that implements, at it\'s core, only four classes.[ðŸŽ¬ 12]

At this rate, if we keep growing it, we\'ll end up passing the database to several objects.

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
tree lib
lib
â”œâ”€â”€ database.rb
â”œâ”€â”€ task_list.rb
â”œâ”€â”€ task.rb
â””â”€â”€ todo_app.rb
```

# Dry-system

This dependency management problem can get very complex very quickly.

But Hanami provides us with a solution: dependency injection using [dry-system](https://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-system/1.0/).[ðŸŽ¬ 13]

To use the `dry-system`{.verbatim} integration, we first need to create a `provider`{.verbatim} under the `config/providers`{.verbatim} directory.[ðŸŽ¬ 14]

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
$ mkdir config/providers
```

Since on the `TodoApp`{.verbatim} class we access the database through the `db`{.verbatim} attribute reader,[ðŸŽ¬ 15] we\'ll call our provider with the same name. Let\'s create de `db.rb`{.verbatim} file[ðŸŽ¬ 16]

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
$ touch config/providers/db.rb
```

Inside this file, we register a new provider[ðŸŽ¬ 17] called `:db`{.verbatim} [ðŸŽ¬ 18] and we pass it a block.[ðŸŽ¬ 19]

Then we call the start method[ðŸŽ¬ 20] and on it\'s block,[ðŸŽ¬ 21] we create the database instance.[ðŸŽ¬ 22]

Finally, we register[ðŸŽ¬ 23] the `db`{.verbatim} [ðŸŽ¬ 24] provider, passing in our `mongo_db`{.verbatim} object.[ðŸŽ¬ 25]

``` ruby
Hanami.app.register_provider(:db) do
  start do
    mongo_db = MyTaskList::Database.load

    register "db", mongo_db
  end
end
```

And that\'s it, we\'ve created our first provider. There is a bit more to say about providers, but we\'ll leave it for a later example.

What we\'ve done here is create a long lived object that we will be able to recall across our application.

Lets use our new provider object in our `TodoApp`{.verbatim}.[ðŸŽ¬ 26]

The first thin we need to do is to include the `Deps`{.verbatim} module[ðŸŽ¬ 27] passing to the brackets[ðŸŽ¬ 28] the dependencies we want to inject as strings.[ðŸŽ¬ 29]

We can now remove the initializer[ðŸŽ¬ 30] and the `db`{.verbatim} attribute reader[ðŸŽ¬ 31] since they will be automatically written for us.

We also need to remove the arguments and parameters in our instance creation method.[ðŸŽ¬ 32]

And, on our `todo_tasks`{.verbatim} [ðŸŽ¬ 33] and `done_tasks`{.verbatim} methods,[ðŸŽ¬ 34] we can keep using the `db`{.verbatim} method to retrieve the database connection. This is due to the attribute reader that `dry-system`{.verbatim} wrote for us.

``` ruby
module MyTaskList
  class TodoApp
    include Deps["db"]

    # ...

    def todo_tasks
      @todo_tasks ||= TaskList.load(db: db, collection_name: :todo_tasks)
    end

    def done_tasks
      @done_tasks ||= TaskList.load(db: db, collection_name: :done_tasks)
    end
  end
end
```

Lastly, we\'ll remove the `db`{.verbatim} arguments to all the calls to `TodoApp.load`{.verbatim} in our actions[ðŸŽ¬ 35]

``` ruby
module MyTaskList
  module Actions
    module Home
      class Show < MyTaskList::Action
        def handle(*, response)
          todo_app = TodoApp.load

          # ...
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

and our specs.[ðŸŽ¬ 36]

``` ruby
Given(:todo_app) { MyTaskList::TodoApp.load }
```

We can now check if our application still works, which it does.[ðŸŽ¬ 37]

Lets now do the same thing with the `TaskList`{.verbatim} class.[ðŸŽ¬ 38]

In this class, we receive the `db`{.verbatim} argument on the `load`{.verbatim} class method.[ðŸŽ¬ 39]

``` ruby

def self.load(db:, collection_name:)
  new(db: db, collection_name: collection_name)
end
```

So we\'ll remove it [ðŸŽ¬ 40] and also take out the `db`{.verbatim} parameter on the call to `new`{.verbatim}.[ðŸŽ¬ 41]

While we\'re near the top of the file, we\'ll include the `Deps`{.verbatim} module[ðŸŽ¬ 42] with the `db`{.verbatim} dependency.[ðŸŽ¬ 43]

``` ruby
include Deps["db"]

def self.load(collection_name:)
  new(collection_name: collection_name)
end
```

This means that we have to remove the argument on the initializer[ðŸŽ¬ 44] along with the instance variable assignment.[ðŸŽ¬ 45]

``` ruby
def initialize(db:, collection_name:)
  @db = db
  @collection = db.client[collection_name]
end
```

And remove the `db`{.verbatim} argument from the `todo_tasks`{.verbatim} [ðŸŽ¬ 46] and `done_tasks`{.verbatim} [ðŸŽ¬ 47] methods on our `TodoApp`{.verbatim}.

``` ruby
def todo_tasks
  @todo_tasks ||= TaskList.load(collection_name: :todo_tasks)
end

def done_tasks
  @done_tasks ||= TaskList.load(collection_name: :done_tasks)
end
```

Since the `TodoApp`{.verbatim} class is the entrypoint to our system, we don\'t need to change anything else to try out our application.

Lets do it by running the specs.[ðŸŽ¬ 48] There\'s an `ArgumentError`{.verbatim} in the initializer.[ðŸŽ¬ 49]

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
docker-compose run --rm web sh -c "bundle exec rspec --options /app/.rspec /app/spec"

FF..FFFFFFFFF

Failures:

  1) My spec todo tasks when description is duplicated       Then { add_task == Failure(MyTaskList::TodoApp::DuplicatedDescription, "Description can't be duplicated") }

     Failure/Error:
       def initialize(collection_name:)
         @collection = db.client[collection_name]
       end

     ArgumentError:
       unknown keyword: :db
```

What\'s this about? Well, as I mentioned before, when we include the `Deps`{.verbatim} module,[ðŸŽ¬ 50] it creates an initializer for us, which means that our constructor has been overriden with a new one that, on this case, has only one parameter: the database, something like this:[ðŸŽ¬ 51]

``` ruby
def initialize(db:)
  @db = db
end
```

So, if we have a class that already has a constructor, we need to remove it and find a workaround for it\'s functionality.

How can we do it? Lets start by analyzing the `initialize`{.verbatim} method.[ðŸŽ¬ 52] It receives a `collection_name`{.verbatim} [ðŸŽ¬ 53] and then it constructs a collection, which gets assigned to the `@collection`{.verbatim} instance variable.[ðŸŽ¬ 54]

``` ruby
def initialize(collection_name:)
  @collection = db.client[collection_name]
end
```

We can move this functionality into it\'s own method, lets call it `collection_name=`{.verbatim}.[ðŸŽ¬ 55]

``` ruby
def collection_name=(collection_name)
  @collection = db.client[collection_name]
end
```

And we can now remove the initializer.[ðŸŽ¬ 56]

This fixes part of the problem.

Now, the load method can\'t send the collection name to the `new`{.verbatim} method,[ðŸŽ¬ 57] so we\'ll need to work around this.

We\'ll start by removing the arguments to `new`{.verbatim} [ðŸŽ¬ 58] and save this new instance in a local variable.[ðŸŽ¬ 59] Then we set the collection name using the method we just created [ðŸŽ¬ 60] and finally we return the new instance.[ðŸŽ¬ 61]

``` ruby
def self.load(collection_name:)
  instance = new
  instance.collection_name = collection_name
  instance
end
```

And now all of our specs pass again.[ðŸŽ¬ 62]

``` ruby
docker-compose run --rm web sh -c "bundle exec rspec --format progress /app/spec"

.............
```

And the application works as expected.[ðŸŽ¬ 63]

# Adding a logger

We\'ve used the database to show how to replace a dependency. Since we\'re working on an application that uses initializers and instance creation methods not just to assign instance variables directly from the constructor arguments, but also has \"complex\" logic in them (a.k.a. constructing a collection from it\'s name),[ðŸŽ¬ 64] injecting dependencies results in a complicated process.

But what if we want to inject a new dependency, something that we\'re not using yet, say, a logger?

The first step as before is to create the provider,[ðŸŽ¬ 65] we\'ll name it `my_logger`{.verbatim},[ðŸŽ¬ 66] because Hanami already ships with one and we don\'t want any colisions.

``` ruby
Hanami.app.register_provider(:my_logger) do

end
```

The previous provider came from inside our `lib`{.verbatim} directory,[ðŸŽ¬ 67] so there was no need to require it.

``` ruby
$ tree lib/
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ my_task_list
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ todo_app.rb
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

But, since we\'re using an objec that\'s not automatically loaded, we need to require it.[ðŸŽ¬ 68]

Then we instantiate a new `Logger`{.verbatim} object[ðŸŽ¬ 69] which will log to a file,[ðŸŽ¬ 70] we configure it\'s log level[ðŸŽ¬ 71] and finally we register our new provider,[ðŸŽ¬ 72] just as we did before.

``` ruby
Hanami.app.register_provider(:my_logger) do
  start do
    require "logger"

    my_logger = Logger.new("./my_task_list.log")
    my_logger.add(Logger::INFO)

    register(:my_logger, my_logger)
  end
end
```

Before going on, remember I\'ve said that there was more to talk about providers.

The provider API Hanami provides is designed to separate the preparation steps from the actual implementation of the provider; so lets honor this.

We\'ll create a `prepare`{.verbatim} block[ðŸŽ¬ 73] where we\'ll move all the require statements[ðŸŽ¬ 74] and any other preparation steps we need to perform before we can start writing actual implementation code.

And we\'ll leave this later concern to the `start`{.verbatim} block, the same way as before.[ðŸŽ¬ 75]

``` ruby
Hanami.app.register_provider(:my_logger) do
  prepare do
    require "logger"
  end

  start do
    my_logger = Logger.new("./my_task_list.log")
    my_logger.add(Logger::INFO)

    register(:my_logger, my_logger)
  end
end
```

Couldn\'t you write everything inside the second block?... Of course you can! But the Hanami team has decided to create this *semantic* separation in order to help us, the developers, organize our code in a meaningful way.

Now we can inject our logger, for example, into the `TodoApp`{.verbatim} class[ðŸŽ¬ 76] and add an `INFO`{.verbatim} message to any method that performs an action.[ðŸŽ¬ 77][ðŸŽ¬ 78][ðŸŽ¬ 79]

``` ruby
module MyTaskList
  class TodoApp
    include Deps["db", "my_logger"]

    def add_task(description:)
      my_logger.info("Creating task: '#{description}'")
      # ...
    end

    def mark_done(description:)
      my_logger.info("Marking DONE: '#{description}'")
      # ...
    end

    def mark_todo(description:)
      my_logger.info("Marking TODO: '#{description}'")
      # ...
    end

    # ...
  end
end
```

While you weren\'t watching I added a route action and view to read the log messages from the log file,[ðŸŽ¬ 80] so lets add some tasks,[ðŸŽ¬ 81] and play around with them.[ðŸŽ¬ 82]

If we navigate to the log reader path,[ðŸŽ¬ 83] we can see that the logger has been properly injected into this class with very little extra code.

# Conclusion

In a pure Ruby application, dependency management can grow in complexity very quickly as our project gets bigger. But Hanami helps us by incorporating `dry-system`{.verbatim} into it\'s arsenal.

By doing so, it provides us with several benefits to simplify our life.

What are those benefits?

We can access all our configured components in a ready to use state.

We also don\'t haev the need to carry arround our setup logic, since it\'s now encapsulated in the component.

On our tests, we can now replace our configuration without any need to mock constants, which, in my opinion, makes for more reliable tests.

The number of objects created by our application goes down, since we now have a centralized location to grab long running objects from without the need of creating new ones. This has the advantage of reducing the memory used by our app.

Finally, a hidden benefit that `dry-system`{.verbatim} provides is *thread-safety*, which is great for working with multi-threaded application servers, such as `puma`{.verbatim}.

In short, with one gem addition, Hanami manages to give us ease of configuration and a lot of benefits.
