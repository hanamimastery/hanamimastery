Working with open source for a long time is tremendous work, [often unappreciated](https://dev.to/david_whitney/open-source-exploitation-5dpj). 

I don't want to be a part of it. I wish a different world, but I want to follow a simple rule in my life, and

:::tip
*Be a change you wish to see in the world.*

.     *- [not Gandhi](https://josephranseth.com/gandhi-didnt-say-be-the-change-you-want-to-see-in-the-world/)*
:::

Having that in mind, let's have some fun, take a moment, and appreciate people who do great, and you get value from it.

**I want to invite you to join me in this initiative of sharing a word of appreciation for one of the OSS heroes you know!**

## A Poem of a Great Rebirth

*Hi, they call me Tim Riley,*

*I'm a ruby geek leaving in Australia*.

*Once I found a project named [Hanami](https://hanamirb.org)*

*And it was for Ruby what for food there is Umami.*

![Hanami 2 like Umami taste](/images/articles/open-source-heroes/hanami-vs-umami.png)

*However great, this project looked a bit dead,*

*'cause there was no one who could keep it led.*

*I said, screw it! I don't like [the Rails way](https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine),*

*but there is nothing I could say,* 

*so let me just take Hanami over,*

*and [wrap it into a completely new cover](https://hanamirb.org/blog/2022/11/22/announcing-hanami-200/).*

<br />

*But there was more needed than just adding a patch,*

*so I had [rewritten it all (not)entirely from scratch](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-system/pull/181).*

![One PR of many during Hanami update](/images/articles/open-source-heroes/one-pr-during-hanami-update.png)

_This is the spirit of **the Open Source Hero,**_

*You just grind, starting sometimes from a complete zero,*

<br />

*if you fail on the road,*

*you better start over,*

*if get lost in the forest of code,*

*find your way like a rover*

*have no time? Get rid of sleep and switch* 

_into extreme **open-source mode**._

<br />

*Now let me give Hanami a lovely final kiss,* 

*to add some views and do the 2.1 release.*

## I challenge you!

If you like the idea I present here, share this, mentioning a person or few from the open source world, that you're especially grateful for the work they do!

Cheers and see you next time!
